<p>Try to create my backend test excercise with inmemory DB still using Hibernate:</p>

<h1> Create a job search REST API for 4 requests: </h1>

<h2>1. POST/client </h2>
<p>Register a new client. Required data: name and email (both max 100 characters, and email have to be unique).</p>
<p>Link for the Rest Template (was built by form or similar): <span><a href="">http://localhost:8080/client?name=<<name>>&email=<<email>></a></span></p>
Response: the API Key (generated by UUID).
	Application/json
	Object
	message - String
2. POST/position
Add a job post. Required data: name (the position's name), location and apiKey (name and location max 50 characters, api key have to be valid). 
Link for the Rest Template (was built by form or similar): http://localhost:8080/position?roleName=<<roleName>>&location=<<budapest>>&apiKey=<<apiKey>>
Response: the URL of the job post.
	Application/json
	Object
	message - String
3. GET/position/search
Search jobs with keyword and/or location. Required data: 
•	keyword (e.g. 'java' - if the position's name is 'java backend developer', 'java' keyword should find it, keyword length: max 50 char),
•	location (max 50 char)
Both data could be stay unfilled. In this case the program shows all the job posts. 
Response: URL list with the matched positions
Link for the Rest Template:
http://localhost:8080/position/search?keyword=<<keyword>>&location=<<location>>&apiKey=<<apiKey>>
Response: URL list with the matched positions
	Application/json
	Object
	message – String
	urlList – ArrayList<String>


4. GET/position/id
Shows details the job post of the id.
Link for the Rest Template:
http://localhost:8080/position/{id}
Response: position details
	Application/json
	Object
	message – String
	urlList – ArrayList<String>
IF your response is an error message, then: 
Response: 
	Application/json
	Object
	message – String
	statusCode – int
	success – Boolean

Further Development Opportunities:
New requests: 
- POST/client/edit -> It allows to set their own data after the registration except the apiKey
- POST/client/delete -> Delete a client
- POST/position/edit -> Update a registered position's data
- POST/position/delete -> Delete a job post

Develop current requests: 
- GET/position/search: searching not only the role name and the location, but also a current advertiser's all posts

To run this code, you need Java11 (with Spring Boot), and MySQL with Hibernate. 
Maven dependencies: Spring web, Hibernate, MySQL Connector
